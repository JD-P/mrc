MRC servers offer a variety of features, some of which require cooperation on the clients part.
Mature clients should offer a software repository of addons and modules that are specific
to certain servers. This way the MRC client can be general software while still allowing
configurability for specific purposes. If a client does not want to host a software repository
then it should leave out the plugin cooperation ability so as to prevent malware, and then in
later versions if a 3rd party is willing to host a reliable repository this repository should be
shipped with the software.
